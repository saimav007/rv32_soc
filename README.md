# rv32_soc
RISCV SoC -This project implements a RISCV SoC with 5-stage pipelined RISC-V RV32IM processor and AXI4 Lite based interconnect with additional modules for branch prediction, hazard detection, forwarding, and multiplication/division support. Furthermore, there are wrappers for AXI4 Master/Slave, the interconnect network and top module connections
